DEPENDENCIES
	OpenGL    <http://opengl.org>
	SDL       <http://libsdl.org>
	SDL_ttf   <http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/>
	SDL_image <http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/>

On OS X, SDL, SDL_ttf, and SDL_image MUST be compiled and installed manually.
They won't link correctly if you have them installed as frameworks. OpenGL is
installed by default on Macs.


INSTALLATION

	$ make
	$ make install

The default installation directories are /usr/local/bin for the executable and
/usr/local/share/pickle for media files. To install to a custom location, set 
the PREFIX and MEDIA_PREFIX environment variables. MEDIA_PREFIX is relative to
PREFIX. In bash:

	$ export PREFIX=/path/to/game
	$ export MEDIA_PREFIX=/media/path

The executable would then be found in /path/to/game/bin/, and media files like
fonts and images would be in /path/to/game/media/path/.

You can also set prefixes when calling make:

	$ make PREFIX=/path/to/game MEDIA_PREFIX=/media/path
	$ make install PREFIX=/path/to/game MEDIA_PREFIX=/media/path
