Prerequisites:
	OpenGL
	SDL
	SDL_ttf
	SDL_image

Installation on Linux:
	$ make
	$ make install

To install to a custom location, set the PREFIX and MEDIA_PREFIX environment variables. MEDIA_PREFIX is relative to PREFIX. In bash:
	$ export PREFIX=/path/to/game
	$ export MEDIA_PREFIX=/media/path

The executable would then be found in /path/to/game/bin/, and media files like fonts and images would be in /path/to/game/media/path/.
